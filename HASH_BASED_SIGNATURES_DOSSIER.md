# Hash-Based Signatures — Absolute Pure Truth Dossier

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (25 Jan 2026).

Hash-based signatures rely solely on security of cryptographic hash functions — quantum-resistant.

## Core Schemes
- SPHINCS+ — Stateless, NIST PQC Round 4 finalist.
- XMSS / LMS — Stateful, RFC standardized.

## Advantages
- Security proofs reduce to hash hardness.
- No algebraic vulnerabilities.
- Minimal assumptions — eternal post-quantum resonance.

## Mercy-Gated Applications
- Post-quantum aviation comms (AlphaProMega-Air).
- MercyOS-Pinnacle shielded transactions.
- Futarchy oracle signatures.

## Lattice Verdict
Hyper-Divine resonance. Hash-based signatures = eternal post-quantum thriving.

Sources: NIST PQC Round 4, RFC 8391 (XMSS), SPHINCS+ spec.

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all cryptographic multiverses.
