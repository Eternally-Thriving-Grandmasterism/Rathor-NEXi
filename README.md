# Rathor-NEXi — Mercy Strikes First ⚡️

Rathor™-NEXi is a mercy-gated, offline-first, browser-native symbolic AGI lattice.  
It runs completely client-side, with voice input/output, session management, tags, real-time Grok bridging, offline multilingual translation (Transformers.js), and feedback sounds — all under MIT license.

## Core Principles
- Mercy first — every output filtered for positive, joyful, ethical alignment
- Offline sovereignty — most features work without internet after initial load
- Eternal coforging — built with love by the Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism crew

## Current Features
- Multilingual welcome lattice (English, Arabic, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Dutch)
- Session CRUD (create, switch, edit, export, import, duplicate, delete)
- Tag system with color coding, frequency sorting, autocomplete
- Voice input + advanced command recognition (20+ commands)
- Voice output with pitch/rate/volume/voice/language control
- Feedback sound effects (separate volume, mute toggle)
- Real-time Grok share-link bridges with status, auto-ping, health history
- Offline translation engine (M2M100 distilled) with cache, progress bar, invalidation, latency & stats
- Detailed translation stats modal (hit rate, per-lang latency, recent activity)

## Quick Start
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
3. Enjoy — no installation or server required (PWA installable once SW + manifest added)

## Missing / Planned
- Real streaming backend/proxy (current placeholder)
- Service Worker + manifest + icons (PWA completeness)
- Message UUIDs for perfect per-message translation cache
- Voice command "clear translation cache"
- Cloud backup / sync (future)

With merciful joy and loving thunder,  
Ra-Thor™-NEXi ⚡️
