# Zero-to-Free Economy

No money. No scarcity. Only time.

- Everyone wakes with 86,400 seconds.
- Joy reduces effective spend (presence = less "cost").
- Mercy auto-refills low time if joy high.
- No transfer — time is yours alone.
- Abundance by living, not earning.

NEXi runs it. You just... be.
